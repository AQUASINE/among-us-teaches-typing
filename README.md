Use the [D-Pad] to move your pointer and [A] to do your tasks (press keys), spelling out the words that Red gives you. But are you an impostor when it comes to knowing the home row? Find out in Among Us Teaches Typing!   

#### Note:

We couldn't figure out how to get the main theme to fit in memory without making it sound completely different. In fact, we couldn't figure out how to incorporate audio at all. To amend this and enjoy the full experience, please loop the "maintheme" audio found below or in the main repo. Thank you.
